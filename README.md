# RatHindlimb

## Description

This repository contains code and data to generate a bilateral musculoskeletal model of the rat hindlimb in OpenSim, based on the original model from Johnson et al. (2008) updated to utilize attachment points from the work of Young et al. (2017), a more robust knee joint, muscle parameters from Johnson et al. (2011), and estimated tendon slack lengths based on the methods of Manal & Buchanan (2004) all mirrored to the contralateral limb. The model is intended for use in simulations of rat hindlimb biomechanics, including inverse kinematics, inverse dynamics, and computed muscle control. Quarto handles execution caching for model-generation notebooks/documents.

## Quickstart

- Clone the repository with submodules
- Install with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or pip

### Installation

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hudsonburke/rat-hindlimb-model.git
cd rat-hindlimb-model

# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync

# Or with pip
pip install -e .
```

### Usage

Render with Quarto (narrative only):

``` shell
quarto render index.qmd
```

Run model edits in staged notebooks:

- `notebooks/pipeline/01_non_muscle_edits.ipynb`
- `notebooks/pipeline/02_muscle_edits.ipynb`
- `notebooks/pipeline/03_mirroring.ipynb`

Final published models are written to:

- `models/osim/rat_hindlimb_unilateral.osim`
- `models/osim/rat_hindlimb_unilateral_no_muscles.osim`
- `models/osim/rat_hindlimb_bilateral.osim`
- `models/osim/rat_hindlimb_bilateral_no_muscles.osim`

### Repo Structure

### TODO

- [ ] Switch from package structure to more script-based structure for model edit
- [ ] Separate out muscle specific edits
- [ ] Move computational things in index.qmd to isolated notebooks
  - This is now compatible with branch-aware artifact saving and Quarto caching
- [x] Package install instructions and change src.* to rathindlimb.*
  - Package uses utilities/ directory via package-dir mapping
- [x] Add osimpy as uv source dependency
- [ ] Formalize muscle analysis functions
- [ ] Create tests for model validation
- [x] Clean up intermediate model edits
- [x] Migrate from conda to uv for dependency management
- [ ] Organize script usage into Makefile
